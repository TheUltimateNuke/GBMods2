# PowerThrow

Very simple patch mod allowing configurable throw force.

## How to configure

- Install the mod by extracting the downloaded zip file to your Gang Beasts installation or installing via mod manager
- Run the game to the main menu, then close it to make sure config files are generated
- Go to `UserData` (or your config files section if using a mod manager)
- Open `MelonPreferences.cfg`
- Change values to your liking. Everything should have descriptions telling you what they do
